# Shazam-Algorithm

Hi, this a music recognizer that I built as a fun project for an at-home weekend hackathon. It implements the Shazam Algorithm in Java and Python, by transforming a signal to the frequency domain (Fourier Analysis) and hashing the most important frequencies for O(1) lookup time. Since this was only a weekend project, I am still in the process of completing the application. I finished most the skeleton code in Python, to unit test the algorithm. I will soon switch to Java to complete my application.
